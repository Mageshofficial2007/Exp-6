# Exp - 6 STUDENT ONLINE EXAM REGISTRATION SYSTEM

# AIM:
To create UML diagrams for Student Online Exam Registration System.
# SRS (Procedure):
Create the following diagrams in StarUML:

Use Case Diagram

Class Diagram

Activity Diagram

Sequence Diagram

Communication Diagram

Package Diagram

1️⃣ Use Case Diagram – Shows interactions between Student, Instructor, Admin, and Payment Gateway for actions like registration, viewing courses, enrollment, and payments.

2️⃣ Class Diagram – Defines main classes (Student, Course, Enrollment, Payment, Instructor, Admin) and relationships (Student–Course many-to-many via Enrollment).

3️⃣ Sequence Diagram – Displays step-by-step flow of enrollment: Student → System → Payment Gateway → Database → Confirmation.

4️⃣ Activity Diagram – Represents workflow: Login → View Courses → Select Course → Make Payment → Confirm Enrollment → Send Notification.

5️⃣ Communication Diagram – Shows message flow among objects: Student, Course, Enrollment System, Payment Gateway through actions like selectCourse(), processPayment(), confirmEnrollment().

6️⃣ Package Diagram – Groups the system into modules: User Management, Course Management, Enrollment Management, Payment System, Notification Service.
